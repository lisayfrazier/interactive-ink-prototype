# Interactive Ink™ Prototype

This is a simple Python demonstration of my **patent-pending educational software concept**, *Interactive Ink™*.  
The goal of Interactive Ink™ is to make reading and learning more engaging for children by allowing them to interact with books — coloring, answering questions, and exploring lessons right on their screens.

##  Features
- Prints an inspirational verse (Matthew 5:16)
- Prompts readers to reflect with a response
- Displays personalized encouragement messages

##  Built With
- Python 3

##  Vision
This early concept represents how Interactive Ink™ will evolve into an AI-powered digital platform that encourages learning through creativity and faith-based interaction.
